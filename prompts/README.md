# Prompts

Structured prompt templates and documentation for the Braniac AI Memory System development.

## Why Prompt Organization

- **Reproducibility**: Documented prompts ensure consistent system behavior and development approach
- **Version Control**: Track prompt evolution and refinements over time
- **Collaboration**: Share effective prompts and techniques across development sessions
- **Documentation**: Preserve the reasoning and context behind system design decisions

## Prompt Categories

- **Specification Prompts**: Initial system specification creation and refinement
- **Implementation Prompts**: Code generation and module development guidance
- **Process Prompts**: Memory process implementation and testing

These prompts serve as both development tools and documentation, capturing the design philosophy and implementation approach for the Braniac AI Memory System.
