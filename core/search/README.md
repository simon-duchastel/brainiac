# Core Search Module

Memory retrieval and indexing functionality for efficient long-term memory access in the Brainiac AI Memory System.

## Why Dedicated Search Module

- **Semantic Retrieval**: Enables context-aware memory search beyond simple keyword matching
- **Hierarchical Indexing**: Leverages directory structure and `_index.md` files for organized memory access
- **Performance**: Optimized search algorithms for large memory repositories
- **Relevance Ranking**: Intelligent ordering of search results based on context and access patterns

## Key Design Decisions

- **Index-Based Search**: Uses `_index.md` manifests and relationship links for semantic navigation
- **Multi-Modal Queries**: Supports both content-based and metadata-based search criteria
- **Access Pattern Integration**: Search results inform and are informed by memory access logging
- **Context Sensitivity**: Search queries generated from working memory context for optimal relevance

This module implements the memory retrieval mechanisms that enable the Core Loop to efficiently locate relevant long-term memories for context assembly, supporting the specification's requirement for intelligent memory access.
