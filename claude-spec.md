# AI Memory and Intelligence System Specification

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
This specification defines an AI memory and intelligence system that provides Large Language Models (LLMs) with persistent, hierarchical memory capabilities that mirror human cognitive architecture. The system enables continuity of knowledge, goals, and context across sessions while maintaining LLM-agnostic implementation.

### 1.2 Core Principles
- **Memory Hierarchy**: Multi-tiered memory system (working, short-term, long-term)
- **LLM Agnostic**: No coupling to specific LLM implementations
- **Plain Text Storage**: Human-readable formats without proprietary dependencies
- **Automatic Management**: Dynamic, self-organizing memory without explicit user direction
- **File System Based**: Leverages standard file operations rather than specialized databases

### 1.3 System Goals
1. Provide persistent memory across LLM sessions
2. Enable automatic knowledge organization and retrieval
3. Support multiple memory types inspired by human cognition
4. Scale from personal to distributed deployment scenarios
5. Maintain transparency and user control over stored information

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Memory Tiers

**Working Memory**
- Contains current conversational context and immediate task information
- Limited capacity corresponding to LLM context window constraints
- Volatile storage that resets between major context switches
- Includes active goals, current conversation, and relevant retrieved memories

**Short-Term Memory**
- Bridges working memory with long-term storage
- Stores recent interactions, emerging concepts, and pending decisions
- Retention period: configurable (hours to days)
- Automatic promotion/demotion based on access patterns and importance

**Long-Term Memory**
- Persistent storage for knowledge, experiences, and relationships
- Hierarchical organization for efficient retrieval
- Multiple specialized memory types
- Automatic reorganization and archival processes

### 2.2 Core Components

**Memory Manager**
- Orchestrates memory operations across all tiers
- Implements promotion/demotion algorithms
- Manages memory organization and pruning processes
- Provides unified interface for memory operations

**Index System**
- Maintains searchable catalogs of memory contents
- Supports hierarchical and associative retrieval
- Updates automatically as memory contents change
- Enables efficient memory querying without scanning entire storage

**LLM Interface Layer**
- Provides standardized API for LLM memory operations
- Handles context injection and memory-aware prompting
- Manages automatic memory capture during interactions
- Abstracts memory complexity from LLM implementations

## 3. Memory Types and Organization

### 3.1 Long-Term Memory Types

**Concrete Memory (Factual Knowledge)**
- Stores facts, procedures, domain knowledge, and learned concepts
- Organized by topic domains and subject hierarchies
- Supports versioning for evolving understanding
- Includes confidence levels and source attribution

**Event Memory (Experiential Records)**
- Chronological record of interactions, decisions, and actions taken
- Timestamped entries with participant and context information
- Supports filtering by time range, participants, or topic
- Maintains conversation threads and task completion records

**Relational Memory (Conceptual Associations)**
- Maps relationships between concepts, topics, and entities
- Supports weighted connections indicating relationship strength
- Enables associative retrieval and context expansion
- Updates automatically based on co-occurrence and explicit connections

**Emotional Memory (Motivational Context)**
- Optional tagging system for priority and sentiment
- Records success/failure outcomes and user satisfaction
- Influences memory importance and retrieval priority
- Supports motivation-aware decision making

### 3.2 Memory Content Structure

All memory entries must include:
- **Unique Identifier**: System-generated ID for reference
- **Timestamp**: Creation and last modification times
- **Content**: Primary information in human-readable format
- **Metadata**: Tags, categories, importance scores, relationships
- **Source**: Origin of information (conversation, inference, external)
