# Core Process Module

Implementation of the four core processes that manage information flow in the Braniac AI Memory System.

## Why Process-Based Architecture

- **Cognitive Modeling**: Mirrors human memory processes with distinct phases for interaction, reflection, and consolidation
- **Asynchronous Design**: Separates real-time user interaction from background memory processing
- **Autonomous Memory**: Processes decide what to remember, forget, and reorganize based on usage patterns
- **Emergent Intelligence**: Memory importance emerges from access patterns rather than explicit scoring

## The Four Core Processes

- **Core Loop (Synchronous)**: Real-time user interaction with LTM retrieval and working memory assembly
- **Reflection (Near-Background)**: Captures interaction context into short-term memory immediately after user exchanges
- **Promotion (Idle)**: Consolidates STM events into structured LTM during inactivity periods
- **Organization (Far-Background)**: Evolves LTM structure based on access patterns and usage analytics

This process architecture implements the specification's human-inspired memory system with autonomous memory management and emergent organizational intelligence.
