# Core Identity Module

Centralized service for managing the AI system's core identity, providing extensible foundation for sophisticated identity management.

## Why Identity Service

- **Future-Proofing**: Simple file reading today, sophisticated identity evolution tomorrow
- **Clean Abstraction**: Removes direct filesystem dependency from core processes
- **Extensibility**: Ready for dynamic persona adaptation and multi-identity support
- **Testability**: Independent testing without filesystem coupling

## Service Architecture

- **CoreIdentityService**: Interface defining identity access patterns
- **DefaultCoreIdentityService**: Current implementation with filesystem integration
- **Extensible Design**: Ready for AI-driven identity evolution and context adaptation

The service abstracts core identity management from the CoreLoopProcess, enabling future enhancements like dynamic personality adaptation, multi-persona support, and identity learning without breaking existing functionality.
